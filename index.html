  <!--AMÉM FINALMENTE TERMINOU, espero que não dê brete-->
      
      <p> Now on the year of 2024, Linkin Park came back to action with Colin Brittain and Emily Armtrong,which was the old vocalist of Dead Sara, and they already released a new album, From Zero. Which is a reference to Shinoda's first band, Xero. And they are already doing a world tour. (Next year I will be there) </p>

      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kivUsDGWojU">One of the new songs here.</a>
      
      </h3>

      <!-- Emily is cooking ngl-->
      
      <p> This one is called Two Faced, the greatest hit of this new era, that talks about how some people was hating she just because she isn't like Chester, which the part "Two Faced" caught in the middle'' says everything about the people who were Chester fans, not real Linkin Park fans. </p>

    <h1> What about Chester? </h1>
       
       <p> Chester was the old vocalist of Linkin Park, with Mike Shinoda, which still is in Linkin Park. Chester commited suicide in 2017, after the album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kaUvGSLMew">"One More Light".</a> He had depression but he was a GREAT vocalist, very amazing. It's sad that he went to another place with such talent.

       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXYiU_JCYtU">May you hear a bit of his art?.</a>

       </h3>

       <!--Chester was soo damn good bro-->
       
       <p> This hit is called "Numb" and it's from the album "Meteora", Which is one of the greatest albuns, just like "Hybird Theory", I hope you like it! </p>
